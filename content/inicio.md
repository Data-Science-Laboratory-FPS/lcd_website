# Translating Health Data & AI into Better Care

## 🚀 Artificial Intelligence and Real-World Evidence for Patient-Centered Decision Making

Our lab facilitates the secondary use of data from the Andalusian Public Health System to support research, development, and innovation, promoting collaborative analysis and the responsible application of artificial intelligence in healthcare. We generate knowledge through AI and Big Data within R&D projects to address clinically relevant questions, build structured data repositories aligned with open science principles, evaluate and validate *AI algorithms* in real-world settings, and design clinical decision support systems in multidisciplinary teams of data engineers, clinicians, and healthcare professionals to meet unmet needs in clinical practice and health system management.

meta: Horizon Europe project
website: https://assess-dht.eu
summary: The overarching objective of ASSESS DHT is to consolidate and streamline existing methods and tools for approval of innovative DHT and develop a new fit-for-purpose generic (overarching) health technology assessment (HTA) framework of Digital Health Technologies (DHTs), harmonised for Europe and aligned with the European Health Data Space (EHDS) Regulation proposal, but also catering for variability between settings, to respond to the methodological challenges with assessing DHTs, including their added value and health benefits for patients and the digital transformation of health systems.

### 🏦 BRIDGE: Breakthrough Regulatory Innovation and Development throuGh sandbox Environments
meta: Horizon Europe project
summary: The BRIDGE project aims to boost health innovation in Europe by developing a framework for designing and operating regulatory sandboxes—controlled environments that enable the testing of new technologies while complying with regulations. It will identify existing sandboxes, create a horizon scanning methodology, and produce case studies, checklists, and evidence packages. Additionally, it will develop MOSAIC, a modular model with functional specifications for implementing these environments. By engaging regulators, industry, funders, providers, and patients in a consultative process, BRIDGE will deliver comprehensive recommendations for legally, effectively, and adaptively applying this methodology in the future.

### 🤰 ePerinatal: Digital Intervention for Perinatal Mental Health
meta: Research project summary: The ePerinatal project evaluates the efficacy of a comprehensive digital health ecosystem designed to prevent and address perinatal depression and anxiety. Through the "Unete" initiative, the study recruits pregnant women to test a mobile health (mHealth) solution that offers continuous emotional monitoring, psychoeducational resources, and cognitive-behavioral tools. The project aims to validate digital biomarkers for early detection of mental health risks, improve maternal and neonatal well-being, and demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of integrating accessible digital mental health interventions into routine perinatal care pathways.

### 💉 RASCAL: Survival Analysis of COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients in Andalusian Hospitals
meta: Regional research project (Andalusia)
summary: The RASCAL project performs survival analysis of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 across Andalusian hospitals. Using both clinical and epidemiological data, it explores key factors associated with in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and post-admission outcomes among COVID-positive patients. The study applies advanced statistical and machine learning survival models implemented in Python and R to identify risk patterns, improve predictive performance, and inform future health system preparedness and patient management strategies.

### 🧠 EII: AI-driven clinical decision support for treatment response prediction in Inflammatory Bowel Disease
meta: Regional research project (Andalusia)
summary: This project focuses on the development and validation of machine learning models for predicting medium- and long-term clinical remission in patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis treated with adalimumab, infliximab, vedolizumab, or ustekinumab. By integrating patient clinical data before and during the first weeks of biologic therapy, the project aims to build a clinical decision support system capable of identifying the most suitable treatment strategy. This approach is expected to enhance therapeutic decision-making, optimize resource allocation, and improve disease management and patient outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease care.

### 🧩 SAIDIS: Intelligent Alert System for the Detection of Severe Suicide Attempts
meta: Regional research project (Andalusia)
summary: SAIDIS aims to develop an intelligent alert system for the early detection of severe suicide attempts through the analysis of electronic health records (EHRs). The project explores novel approaches based on open-source large language models (LLMs) and other AI techniques to identify clinical patterns and linguistic markers associated with high-risk behaviors. By leveraging natural language understanding and predictive modeling, SAIDIS seeks to support mental health professionals in timely intervention and prevention strategies.

### 🚑 trIAje: AI-based Optimization of Emergency Call Triage
meta: Regional research project (Andalusia, CCUE)
summary: The trIAje project applies advanced artificial intelligence techniques —including supervised learning, deep learning, and natural language processing— to optimize the telephone triage process of the Andalusian Emergency Coordination Center (CCUE). Using both structured data (triage questions) and unstructured data (free-text notes from emergency calls), the project develops predictive models to improve the accuracy of classifying critical emergencies such as cardiac arrest, respiratory distress, chest pain, and stroke. By identifying key predictive variables and evaluating model performance through sensitivity, specificity, and false positive/negative rates, trIAje aims to enhance clinical decision-making, reduce unnecessary alarms, and improve emergency care outcomes across the regional system.

### 💉 COVID-19 Project - Vaccine Effectiveness and Risk Factors in COVID-19
meta: Regional research project
summary: A retrospective, population-based cohort study assessing risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality among the Andalusian population throughout the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to April 2022), and estimating vaccine effectiveness for these severe outcomes. The project analyses demographic, clinical, and epidemiological variables to quantify vaccine performance and identify patient profiles associated with severe disease. Its analytical framework, incorporating machine-learning techniques, provides the foundation for subsequent COVID-19 derivative studies.

### 💉 COVID-19 BRANDS -  Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine Brand Effectiveness
meta: Regional research project
summary: This project evaluates the effectiveness of different COVID-19 vaccine brands, stratified by number of doses and considering both homologous and heterologous vaccination schemes, in preventing severe clinical outcomes (hospitalization, ICU admission, and 30-day mortality) among individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Andalusia, Spain. This study builds on the primary COVID-19 vaccine cohort by incorporating detailed risk-factor modelling to identify differences in protection across vaccine types and schemes

### 🌍 COVID-19 SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS - Analysis of Social Determinants of Health and COVID-19 Outcomes
meta: Regional research project
summary: This project examines how Social Determinants of Health (SDH) influence SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes (hospitalization, ICU admission, and 30-day mortality) in Andalusia. It integrates sociodemographic indicators, such as the loneliness index and unemployment rate, and applies machine-learning models to quantify the contribution of municipality-level social disparities and other risk factors to adverse outcomes. The findings aim to support public health planning and equity-oriented interventions.

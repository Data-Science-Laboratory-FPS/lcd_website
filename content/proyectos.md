meta: Horizon Europe project
website: https://assess-dht.eu
summary: The overarching objective of ASSESS DHT is to consolidate and streamline existing methods and tools for approval of innovative DHT and develop a new fit-for-purpose generic (overarching) health technology assessment (HTA) framework of Digital Health Technologies (DHTs), harmonised for Europe and aligned with the European Health Data Space (EHDS) Regulation proposal, but also catering for variability between settings, to respond to the methodological challenges with assessing DHTs, including their added value and health benefits for patients and the digital transformation of health systems.

### 🏦 BRIDGE: Breakthrough Regulatory Innovation and Development throuGh sandbox Environments
meta: Horizon Europe project
summary: The BRIDGE project aims to boost health innovation in Europe by developing a framework for designing and operating regulatory sandboxes—controlled environments that enable the testing of new technologies while complying with regulations. It will identify existing sandboxes, create a horizon scanning methodology, and produce case studies, checklists, and evidence packages. Additionally, it will develop MOSAIC, a modular model with functional specifications for implementing these environments. By engaging regulators, industry, funders, providers, and patients in a consultative process, BRIDGE will deliver comprehensive recommendations for legally, effectively, and adaptively applying this methodology in the future.

### 💉 RASCAL: Survival Analysis of COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients in Andalusian Hospitals
meta: Regional research project (Andalusia)
summary: The RASCAL project performs survival analysis of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 across Andalusian hospitals. Using both clinical and epidemiological data, it explores key factors associated with in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and post-admission outcomes among COVID-positive patients. The study applies advanced statistical and machine learning survival models implemented in Python and R to identify risk patterns, improve predictive performance, and inform future health system preparedness and patient management strategies.

### 🧠 EII: AI-driven clinical decision support for treatment response prediction in Inflammatory Bowel Disease
meta: Regional research project (Andalusia)
summary: This project focuses on the development and validation of machine learning models for predicting medium- and long-term clinical remission in patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis treated with adalimumab, infliximab, vedolizumab, or ustekinumab. By integrating patient clinical data before and during the first weeks of biologic therapy, the project aims to build a clinical decision support system capable of identifying the most suitable treatment strategy. This approach is expected to enhance therapeutic decision-making, optimize resource allocation, and improve disease management and patient outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease care.

### 🧩 SAIDIS: Intelligent Alert System for the Detection of Severe Suicide Attempts
meta: Regional research project (Andalusia)
summary: SAIDIS aims to develop an intelligent alert system for the early detection of severe suicide attempts through the analysis of electronic health records (EHRs). The project explores novel approaches based on open-source large language models (LLMs) and other AI techniques to identify clinical patterns and linguistic markers associated with high-risk behaviors. By leveraging natural language understanding and predictive modeling, SAIDIS seeks to support mental health professionals in timely intervention and prevention strategies.

### 🚑 trIAje: AI-based Optimization of Emergency Call Triage
meta: Regional research project (Andalusia, CCUE)
summary: The trIAje project applies advanced artificial intelligence techniques —including supervised learning, deep learning, and natural language processing— to optimize the telephone triage process of the Andalusian Emergency Coordination Center (CCUE). Using both structured data (triage questions) and unstructured data (free-text notes from emergency calls), the project develops predictive models to improve the accuracy of classifying critical emergencies such as cardiac arrest, respiratory distress, chest pain, and stroke. By identifying key predictive variables and evaluating model performance through sensitivity, specificity, and false positive/negative rates, trIAje aims to enhance clinical decision-making, reduce unnecessary alarms, and improve emergency care outcomes across the regional system.

### 💉 Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine Brands in Andalusia

meta: Regional research project
summary: This project evaluates the real-world effectiveness of different European COVID-19 vaccine brands in Andalusia between 2020 and 2022. Using population-based data and machine learning methods, it analyses how each brand relates to key clinical outcomes —hospital admission, ICU admission, and 30-day mortality— in infected patients. The study extends the original Vaccine Effectiveness and Risk Factors in COVID-19 proyect cohort and incorporates detailed risk-factor modelling to identify differences in protection across vaccine types.

### 💉 Vaccine Effectiveness and Risk Factors in COVID-19

meta: Regional research project
summary: A retrospective, population-level cohort study assessing risk factors for hospitalisation, ICU admission, and mortality among SARS-CoV-2–infected individuals in Andalusia. The project examines demographic, clinical, and epidemiological variables to quantify vaccine effectiveness and identify patient profiles associated with severe outcomes. Its analytical framework, built in R and ML techniques, provides the foundation for subsequent derivative studies.

### 🌍 Social Determinants of Health and COVID-19 Outcomes

meta: Regional research project
summary: This project investigates how Social Determinants of Health —derived from IECA public datasets— influence hospital admission, ICU admission, and mortality in COVID-19 cases in Andalusia. Complementing Vaccine Effectiveness and Risk Factors in COVID-19 proyect, it integrates sociodemographic indicators with clinical variables and applies ML models in R and Python to quantify the contribution of social inequality and other risk factors to adverse outcomes. The results aim to inform public health planning and equity-focused interventions.
